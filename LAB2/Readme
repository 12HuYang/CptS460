Part A. PRE_WORK: NO turn-in but you MUST do these 

Use YOUR printf() function to do the following:

(1). Run the Program MTX4.0 in 4.3.
     In YOUR main(): print "This is my first OS kernel"

(2). Run the Multitasking program MTX4.1 in 4.3.3

(3). Run the Dynamic Process program MTX4.2 in 4.4.

=======================================================================
Part B. REQUIREMENTS:

   IMPLEMENT exit, sleep, wakeup, wait functions in the MTX kernel.


   Download files from samples/LAB2. 
   mtximage is a FD image contining solution.

   Run QEMY on mtximage: The command menu is

           [s|f|q|w ] 

   where s : switch process
         f : kfork a child process
         q : process exit with a value
         w : wait for a ZOMBIE child

Write YOUR C code (per Chapter 4) for 
     
     int ksleep(int event);
     int kwakeup(int event);

     int kexit(int exitvalue);
     int kwait(int *status);

Make YOUR t.c file work as in the SOLUTION.
